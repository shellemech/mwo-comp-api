  p #[span.emph How can I check if my match is already in the database?] You don't need to! You can submit it anyway - The indexer will only store a match once as the match id is unique. If you still want to check, see useful searches below.
    
  p #[span.emph Can I create my own charts and dashboard items in Kibana?] Kibana is setup for public access for now, so anyone can create searches or charts. Anyone can also delete them, so use as a temporary resource.

  p #[span.emph Can I search for MRBC matches?] Season 10 results are added automatically under the index 'mwomrbc'.
